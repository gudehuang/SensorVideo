     * This type returns the angle between the magnetic north and the projection
     * of the axis starting from the lower left corner to the upper left corner
     * of the device.
     * In case of the device natural orientation i.e Portrait for phone and Landscape
     * for tablet, this value is the value[0] of getOrientation of the SDK SensorManager class.
     * However, this type also returns the correct direction independent of type of devices
     * as well as requested screen orientation of the activity. For example for tablet and
     * the activity is in Portrait only, the value return is either the direction of the
     * X-axis or minus X-axis depending on the manufacturer. If the activity does not set
     * orientation preference then when the activity started the direction is the direction
     * of the axis parallel to where the user looks.
     * Thus for a compass app, all you need to do is to call DSensorManager.startDProcessedSensor
     * passing in this type.
     * The value for this sensor will be from -PI to PI when the device is flat and Float.NAN otherwise.
     *
     * Note: this type required the device to have sensor of TYPE_MAGNETIC_FIELD and
     * TYPE_GRAVITY or TYPE_ACCELEROMETER
